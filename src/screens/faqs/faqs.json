Harvesting rainwater is an ancient practice and you might have think that why are we practicing it. Because, till today this valuable practice in growing in popularity due to its various benefits in our modern times. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the most acceptable and sustainable method/solution to attenuate water crisis issues in the both rural and urban areas all over the world. The system involves simple collection and storing of rainwater from surfaces it falls so that it can be used for later use (domestic, commercial or agriculture purposes). The capacity of the water storage tank would be 200 gallons for 5-marla house, 400 gallons for 10-marla house, 600 gallons for 1-kanal house, and 800 gallons for 2-kanal house as per government by-laws (CDA & RDA)."

It will help you gain trust because it’s a matter of your dream house and you all life savings. You can find trusted and approved contractor list from our app as well.",
        "Keep in view these points mentioned below while signing agreement: \nWhat are the rates and which scope of works are included\nTimeline for the completion of work as mentioned like grey structure etc.\nIf you are doing with material agreement then please specify material and material make. Take samples of every material at the time of agreement so you can cross check at the time of execution\nMaterial testing reports should be on contractor head, so this should be checked on every delivery of material.\nFines should be apply on contractor on per day basis if projects gets delay from the delivery date as mentioned in agreement.\nAgreement should be made on stamp papers so no one can disobey from this. Not client neither contractor.\nIf you are going on per square feet rate than mentioned your total covered area on your agreement\nKindly finalize the other works which are not included in the covered area e.g. Boundary walls, parapet walls, UGWT, Septic Tank, OHWT etc.\nAlso mention the works which are not included in agreement with contractor.\nContractor should be able to read construction working drawings like structural drawings, architectural drawings, MEP drawings etc.\nPayment modes should be finalized on each milestone achievement."

The continuous strip acts as support for which walls are built and is to a width to spread the load evenly of the building on the ground underneath it, supporting it.\nRecommendations: Strip foundation are used where ground is stable and bearing capacity is fine and not soil filling land. Bearing capacity should more than 0.8 Ton per square feet for strip foundation."

          "answer": "Ready Mix Concrete is mixed from plant as per the requirement you want like 1:2:4 or 1:4:8 and shifted to site in Transit Mixers (TM) and poured at site through concrete pump. Ready mix concrete is more recommended because of the mixing of ingredients and less chances of segregation whereas on site mixing is not that satisfactory, on site mixing causes segregation and losing strength before pouring and this also gets dry before pouring."

        {
          "question": "How can you check concrete quality on site before pouring or during pouring?",
          "answer": "Before pouring concrete will be test through slump test. Slump test define water cement ratio. In which you can test is water is excessively used or not in concrete. During pouring you have to check factors like too much using vibrator in concrete will cause bleeding (Cement slurry leaves concrete and comes on top the surface is called bleeding) and segregation in concrete (Segregation in which all mixture of concrete like cement, sand and crush loose it’s bond between them, this process is called segregation). This all process causes honey-combing, decrease in density, and ultimately loss of strength of concrete."

Use sufficient quantity of cement to achieve required water tightness and strength as per recommendation of your site engineer. \n3. Mix the concrete thoroughly for getting better homogeneity.\n4. Keep the water-cement ratio as minimum as possible.\n5. Compact the freshly placed concrete to remove air bubbles and voids.\n6. Cure the concrete properly at least for 28 days.\n7. Maintain the concrete temperature above the freezing point until it becomes hard enough."

          "answer": "Septic tank is used to collect sewage and waste water of the house and then through pump you can extract waste water to main sewer lines of area whereas remained sludge in septic tank extract through sewer pump. In basements washrooms and kitchen wastewater cannot be extract through gravity to main holes and then to main sewer line of the society so septic tank is important to play role in extracting wastewater from the basement."
